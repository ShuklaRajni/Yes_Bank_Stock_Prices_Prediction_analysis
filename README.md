# Introduction:
In our project our goal is to build a prediction model for close price prediction, which focuses on short-term price prediction. A stock market is a public market where you can buy and sell shares for publicly listed companies. The stocks, also known as equities, represent ownership in the company. The stock exchange is the mediator that allows the buying and selling of shares. Stock markets help companies to raise capital.
• It helps generate personal wealth. 
• Stock markets serve as an indicator of the state of the economy. 
• It is a widely used source for people to invest money in companies with high growth potential. 

Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations.
